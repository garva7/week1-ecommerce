# ShopEasy

A full-stack eCommerce web application built with Flask, MySQL, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The project was built incrementally over four weeks as part of a training curriculum, starting from static HTML pages and ending with a working admin panel, server-side pagination, and AJAX form submission.

## What it does

- Displays clothing products across three categories: Men, Women, and Kids
- Each category has subcategories, and products are linked to those subcategories
- Users can register, log in, and log out
- Passwords are stored as hashes, never plain text
- A logged-in admin user can manage categories, subcategories, and products through an admin panel
- The product listing page supports server-side search and pagination
- A contact form on the homepage submits via AJAX and stores enquiries in the database

---

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Database:** MySQL (via PyMySQL), with SQLite as an optional fallback
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, jQuery
- **Templating:** Jinja2

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- MySQL running via XAMPP or any local MySQL installation

### Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows (Git Bash)
source .venv/Scripts/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database setup (MySQL)

1. Start MySQL from the XAMPP control panel
2. Open phpMyAdmin at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
3. Create a database named `shopeasy`
4. Confirm `config.py` has the MySQL URI active:

```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "mysql+pymysql://root:@localhost/shopeasy"
```

The default XAMPP root user has no password. If yours does, add it after the colon.

### Create tables and seed data

```bash
python seed.py
```

This drops and recreates all tables and inserts sample categories, subcategories, products, and a demo user. Run it again any time you want to reset the database.

### Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## Demo credentials

| Role  | Email                  | Password |
|-------|------------------------|----------|
| Admin | demo@shopeasy.com      | demo123  |

Only this account can access the admin panel at `/admin/`. Any other registered account is a regular user.

## How the main features work

**Template inheritance:** Every page extends `base.html` using Jinja2 blocks. The base file holds the navbar, flash messages, and footer. Individual pages only define their own content block. The admin panel has its own `base_admin.html` for the same reason.

**Authentication:** Passwords are hashed with `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` before being stored. On login, `check_password_hash` compares the input against the stored hash. The user's id and name are saved in Flask's session cookie on success.

**Admin access control:** The `admin_required` decorator on every admin route checks that the logged-in user's email matches the admin email constant. Any other user is redirected to the homepage with an error message.

**Category and subcategory structure:** Both are stored in the same `categories` table. Top-level categories have `parent_id = NULL`. Subcategories have `parent_id` set to their parent's id. The `Category` model has a self-referential relationship so `category.subcategories` and `subcategory.parent` work directly in code and templates.

**Product filtering:** When a category is selected, the app collects the category's own id and all its subcategory ids, then queries for products whose `subcategory_id` is in that set. This means filtering by "Men" returns products from Men's Shirts, Men's Jeans, and any other subcategory under Men.

**Pagination:** SQLAlchemy's `.paginate()` method takes a page number and a per-page limit. The current page is read from the URL query string. The template renders previous, next, and numbered page links, and preserves the active search and category filters across page changes.

**Enquiry form:** Validation runs client-side with jQuery before anything is sent. Each field is checked individually and Bootstrap's `is-invalid` class is applied to show error messages inline. On passing validation, `$.ajax()` sends the data as JSON to `/enquiry`. Flask validates again server-side, saves the record to the `enquiries` table, and returns a JSON response. jQuery then shows a success or error alert inside the modal without reloading the page.
